Social Support Network Mapping (SSNM) RFP on Hugo platform, to house the mapping tool.


The SSNM is a simple web-based tool intended for use by social workers and other human service, health or mental health workers in support of clients or community members. The tool was evolved from early versions of paper-based social network and ecomapping tools. The purpose of the tool is to identify and graphically illustrate the informal social supports in a personâ€™s network either in general, or specifically related to an issue for work, like gaining employment, or housing, or getting into recovery, for example.
